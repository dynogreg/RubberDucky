. PowerslavesPasswordGrabber general informations															  .
.																								  .
. PowerslavesPasswordGrabber is a Payload for the HAK5/USB_Rubber_Ducky, if you don't own a Rubber Ducky you  .
. can order one at http://hakshop.myshopify.com/products/usb-rubber-ducky.  					  .
. However, this toolkit includes a set of freeware password sniffers and a batch file (launch.bat).
. which will run on a regular USB Stick aswell, you just need to name it DUCKY (Important!) and   .
. you have to run the "launch.bat" file by clicking it.											  .
.																								  .
. But i strongly recommend using the Ducky, everything runs automatically, no need to touch the   .
. mouse of the target PC and its a really nifty toy for other stuff too, just get one. Trust me   .
.																								  .
. 1. Setting up the duck																		  .
.																								  .
. To run this Payload on the Rubber Ducky, you need to make sure that you run the right firmware. .
. Since we use the Ducky as Mule for the Password Sniffer .exe files and the Batch file, maybe    .
. there is a better way in the future since its a pretty slow device if it comes to file traffic. .
. However, i decided to use the C_Duck Firmware (Version 2.1) you can download the firmware from  .
. https://code.google.com/p/ducky-decode/downloads/list , you will find other apps we will need   .
. aswell there, and a guide on how to flash the Duck with other firmwares like C_Duck. I won't    .
. explain it here, since the guide on the Wiki site is very nice and there is no need to write    .
. another one. I know i am lazy, sorry ;-) 														  .
. After that copy the folders exec and logs in the Root directory of the microSD card. next comes .
. the payload.                                                        							  .
.																								  .
. 2. Encoding the Payload																		  .
. 																								  .
. Follow the Guide on: https://code.google.com/p/ducky-decode/wiki/Payload_Guide , use the encoder.
. on the "PWsniffer.txt" file inside the "payload" folder. The Powershell prompt sould look some- .
. thing like that: PS C:\Ducky Encoder\> java -jar encoder.jar -i PWsniffer.txt -o inject.bin  ** .
. ** depending on your keyboard layout you need to add -l resources\us.properties (us = USA)      .
. Now make sure the fresh encoded inject.bin is copied in the root directory of the microSD card. .
. Instead of encoding it yourself you can use the inject.bin file i encoded, however i don't      .
. recommend using inject.bin files from others, you never know what is really inside.			  .
. But of course i am one of the nice guys and i won't harm you, or do i?  						  .

.																								  .
. 3. Let the duck do the job! 																	  .
. 																								  .
. Well if everything worked fine until now, and the encoded inject.bin is on a microSD placed     .
. a duck butt, you are ready for a first test run. Depending on the start DELAY the duck will     .
. run after a second (This is default setting for testing on your own box). However, if you       .
. use the rubber ducky on a "virgin" machine, which had never contact with a ducky, there will    .
. be a initial deadline, since the driver has to be installed on windows first, the good thing:   .
. this happens automatically, you don't even have to click (This is a w/o UAC Payload).           .
. The bad thing: this may take some time, depending on the power of the target PC, i am working   .
. on a fast Box with 8 Core I7 Ivy Bridge CPU, and 16 Gigs of RAM, running with a semi-fast HDD.  .
. This is my working PC, the initial driver setup still needs like 10 sec, so 2x a DELAY 10000    .
. may not be the worst idea, but don't forget, 20 seconds can be an eternity depending on the Job .
. 																								  .
. 4. The end																					  .
.																								  .
. Since, this payload is still in development, nothing is really done, the readme isn't done the  .
. speed is still slow, but its still working, and there is potential.							  .
.																								  .
. 5. The future																					  .
.																								  .
. First, the script will be tweaked and tested on other machines, top priority has the speed.     .
. another task is hiding the CMD window, and the batch file still needs some modifications.       .
. Well i don't know alot about copyright, but everything inside this archive is freeware.         .
. My payload is open-source and free aswell, use it as you wish, enhance it, whatever.            .
. BUT: I won't take any responsibility for anything that may happen with this tool, i actually    .
. use it to gather my own accounts and store them somewhere safe, pretty usefull and nobody       .
. dies. Use but don't abuse, or at least, don't get caught...                                     .
.                                                                                                 .
. PS: i know my english sucks very hard, if you want to correct it and send me a clean version    .
. back, i won't stop you.                                                    POWERSLAVE           .
